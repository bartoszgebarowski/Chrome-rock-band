# Samurai - chrome rock band

## Site overview

Chrome rock band is a website that treats Samurai band as real, separate entity from Cyberpunk 2077. The game itself is set in a dystopian environment, ruled by large corporations and full of social inequalities. 
The music in the game was performed by real musicians from Refused, and Johnny Silverhand's appearance was modeled after popular actor Keanu Reeves. He is also Johnny's voice in the game.
Judging from the monthly Spotify listeners and the views of each song on Youtube, there is a strong incentive to create a website that features Refused's alter ego in-game, as many fans of the game seem to have liked this kind of musicians incarnation. This website aims to fulfill, to some extent, this purpose while remaining faithful to the source material. The project was built to answer following, potential users needs:

* Can i check the band's new releases ??
* When i can hear them live ? 
* Can I listen to their music for free?
* Is there any band's merchandise that i can buy ?
* What instruments are they playing on ?
* How i can contact them ? 

While some of these needs are beyond the scope of this project, the author of this website has endeavored to answer all of these questions in order to take full advantage of the newly acquired skills.

As a side note: although this site contains slang elements, it generally avoids the use of swearing, with one exception (it was censored during the development process)

Material above served as promotional material during E3 event. This is an iconic and well-known quote that it would be a huge oversight not to include it in the project.

## Design

### Color Scheme 

The choice of the appropriate color was dictated by following factors:

- Is it connected to CD Projekt RED, Cyberpunk 2077 or Samurai ?
- Is it related to a specific brand, in such a manner, that the user is expecting specific correlation between element and the color ? 
- Are the interactive and non interactive elements are distinguished consistently across pages ?
- Is it compatible with the WCAG 2.0 contrast standard ?

Connections to website subject or connotations to specific brands, were checked by performing meticulous web research. If such resources were not available, Firefox color selector tool was used instead.

To ensure compliance with WCAG 2.0 standard, contrast-grid tool was used, which can be found at the link below:
